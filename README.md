## 🌌 Features

- **Interactive Quantum Field Visualization** - Beautiful particle system with 150+ animated particles
- **Manifestation Creation** - Input your desires with categories and intensity levels
- **Progress Tracking** - Watch your manifestations align with the quantum field
- **Energy Monitoring** - Real-time energy level indicators
- **Data Persistence** - All manifestations saved locally
- **Premium Design** - Glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, and cosmic aesthetics

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Enter Your Desire** - Type what you wish to manifest
2. **Select Category** - Choose from Wealth, Health, Love, Career, etc.
3. **Set Intensity** - Adjust the manifestation power (1-10)
4. **Send to Quantum Field** - Watch the quantum encoding animation
5. **Track Progress** - Monitor your manifestations as they align with reality
